# Art Galleries Navigator

## Rails portfolio project

This is a complete Ruby on Rails application that manages data about artists and galleries through complex forms and RESTful routes. It is a Content Management System, where artists can find galleries to participate in with their paintings, or can add a new gallery. Each artist must be logged in in order to have an access to any content. Logging in is also available via existing Facebook account.
