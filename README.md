# Art Galleries Navigator

## Rails App with a jQuery Front End

This is a complete Ruby on Rails application with dynamic features that are possible through jQuery and a JSON API. The application manages data about artists and galleries through complex forms and RESTful routes. It is a Content Management System, where artists can find galleries to participate in with their paintings, or can add a new gallery. Each artist must be logged in in order to have an access to any content. Logging in is also available via existing Facebook account.

## Install instructions
